There’s sure to be a lot of red meat for Republicans and eye rolling from Democrats, but there’s also a wildcard in this year’s debate: Donald Trump.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESince Trump announced his candidacy in June, his poll numbers have done nothing but increase. What’s Trump done?  Call Mexican illegal immigrants criminals. Polls go up. Give out Sen. Lindsay Graham’s cell phone. Polls go up. Suggest John McCain isn’t a war hero because he was a POW. Still leads the polls. So just how does one debate Donald Trump and win?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe first thing we must understand is that a presidential debate is not like an academic debate. In an academic debate or in a courtroom, people who are trained to evaluate evidence and arguments get to make the decisions on who wins/loses. In a presidential debate, the American people get to evaluate the arguments. \\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003EDonald Trump brings an elitist bravado back to the Republican Party. \\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003EThe American electorate is not trained to assess the arguments and they may not be informed enough on specific issues to follow those arguments based on the relatively short answer time allowed by the formats.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAt the end of the debate, the news media will report clips that grab the headlines. What will likely make the news is a smart or a sassy one-liner, like when Ronald Reagan put to rest concerns about his mental capacity in his second debate with Walter Mondale, by answering the question about whether a candidate\\u0026#8217;s age should matter by saying, \\u0026#8220;I will not, for political purposes, exploit my opponent\\u0026#8217;s youth and inexperience.\\u0026#8221; Everyone laughed, and suddenly Reagan\\u0026#8217;s incompetence in the first debate no longer mattered.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe second factor that matter is the fact that people tend to vote for the candidates they like the most. This has come to be called the “beer test.” And for some Republicans, Donald Trump brings an elitist bravado back to the Republican Party. Do most people think they’d like to have a beer with Donald Trump? Honestly, probably not. But in a race with 15 other candidates, Donald Trump is a well-known personality—a celebrity—that has defined, an refined his career by delivering one-liners.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003E Trump’s rhetoric will beg for a gut reaction that only serves to help seal a candidate’s fate. \\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003EDebating Donald has both pros and cons. Being on stage means getting more press. Fox News has put Donald Trump front and center on the stage flanked by Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, the two other candidates with double-digit approval ratings. Debates offer candidates the opportunity to gain free publicity for their ideas and intellect.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe negative of appearing with Trump, however, is that one has no idea what he might say or do. It is imperative that candidates not respond to him in a way that makes them look unlikable or incompetent. Trump’s rhetoric will beg for a gut reaction that only serves to help seal a candidate’s fate.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIf any one of the candidates were my clients, I would tell them to be more concerned with his own image. It is important to come across well informed and likable. The danger for Trump is that someone could easily get him to lose his cool and do something else that voters might perceive as un-presidential.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe take home that many candidates must remember is that Trump, even though he is leading in the polls, is not seen by virtually any political experts as being a viable candidate. Trump, however, can do significant damage to candidate’s outlook. While it’s highly unlikely he will be the candidate, he will ultimately help Republicans select one.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EWe welcome your comments at\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://ideas@qz.com\\\"\\u003E ideas@qz.com\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=474040\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/474040/a-gop-candidates-guide-to-debating-donald-trump-dont-debate-him/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-08-06T11:05:01-07:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/preview/474040\",\"dc_creator\":\"Nichelle McNabb\",\"media_content_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/rtx1mk3v.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#38;strip=all\\u0026#38;w=150\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"RICOH Women\\u0026#039;s British Open 2015\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/rtx1mk3v.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#38;strip=all\\u0026#38;w=150\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/474040/a-gop-candidates-guide-to-debating-donald-trump-dont-debate-him/"], ["published_at", Thu, 06 Aug 2015 18:05:01 UTC +00:00], ["title", "A GOP candidate&#8217;s guide to debating Donald Trump: don&#8217;t debate him"], ["updated_at", Thu, 06 Aug 2015 22:42:28 UTC +00:00]]

Over the past few years, like many people, we\\u0026#8217;ve watched an increasing percentage of original \\u0026#8220;television\\u0026#8221; produced and distributed by services that have nothing to do with a cable subscription, namely Netflix and Amazon. We are watching via a small streaming-media box that the cable industry could only dream of creating, using the fast internet connection provided by Time Warner Cable.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt works pretty well. And now we can get HBO, too!\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMeanwhile, the pay TV industry has done very little to improve the value of its service, especially relative to how much progress the competition has made.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cul\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003EIts much-lauded \\u0026#8220;TV Everywhere\\u0026#8221; concept, which was supposed to let you log in with your account and access lots of video all over the internet, is a dud. It\\u0026#8217;s hard to set up and often doesn\\u0026#8217;t work, seemingly because the video provider didn\\u0026#8217;t have the right agreement with the cable provider. Thanks!\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003EThe cable-box software and on-demand interface—an area where cable should have provided real, \\u0026#8220;free\\u0026#8221; competition to streaming services—is still horrendous. (Comcast, the largest US cable provider, has actually done some decent work with its X1 system, but it\\u0026#8217;s not available here in New York.) So even if we had cable, we would still need Netflix and Hulu.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003EThe quality of programming on traditional pay TV hasn\\u0026#8217;t improved, relative to the stuff on Netflix and the like. The shows we loved the most—and made a point to watch live—are gone. And the shows we\\u0026#8217;re increasingly drawn to aren\\u0026#8217;t exclusive to cable.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n\\u003C/ul\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EImportant caveat: We don\\u0026#8217;t watch a lot of live sports beyond baseball streaming. That\\u0026#8217;s still a strong selling point for pay TV services, though even the sports juggernaut ESPN \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/08/05/media/disney-stock-down-espn/\\\"\\u003Esuddenly seems vulnerable\\u003C/a\\u003E.

The most obvious are the tax incentives linked to 401(k) and similar retirement accounts. But some are questioning if those benefits are worth the cost.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt\\u0026#8217;s a pretty simple system: You put part of your salary into an investment account before paying tax, can\\u0026#8217;t access that money (unless you pay a penalty) until you turn 59.5, and then pay tax when you take the money out.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut the tax deferral isn\\u0026#8217;t cheap for the government, which is why it becomes a target when people start talking about the federal budget. The \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown\\u0026amp;id=4663\\\"\\u003EJoint Committee on Taxation \\u003C/a\\u003Eestimates employer-sponsored defined contribution plans will cost the government $399 billion in forgone revenue between 2014 and 2018.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAnd for what benefit? \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://obs.rc.fas.harvard.edu/chetty/ret_savings.html\\\"\\u003EResearch from Denmark suggests\\u003C/a\\u003E tax incentives don\\u0026#8217;t increase savings. Automatically enrolling people into saving accounts—whether the money has been taxed or not—and selecting a saving rate for them is much more effective and needn\\u0026#8217;t cost the government anything.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThese tax incentives also come under fire because they are arguably more \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://blogs.marketwatch.com/encore/2013/08/06/do-401k-plans-favor-the-rich/\\\"\\u003Ebeneficial to high earners\\u003C/a\\u003E, who are more eager to lower their tax bill and are more likely to have access to a retirement account.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ENo wonder \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.newamerica.org/economic-growth/expanded-social-security/\\\"\\u003Esome have suggested\\u003C/a\\u003E the US eliminate special tax treatment for these accounts. \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chancellor-george-osbornes-summer-budget-2015-speech\\\"\\u003EChancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne\\u003C/a\\u003E thinks the UK should do so. He\\u0026#8217;d prefer Britons make post-tax contributions and get tax-free withdrawals—sort of like a Roth account in America. The Financial Times \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/495bed92-294d-11e5-8613-e7aedbb7bdb7.html#axzz3geVzyezd\\\"\\u003EChris Giles agrees\\u003C/a\\u003E, arguing that tax deferred pensions are opaque and offer little value. But these arguments are short-sighted; the value of the tax deferral is not just getting people to save more.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFirst of all, most estimates overstate the cost to tax-payers. 401(k)s are tax \\u003Cem\\u003Edeferred\\u003C/em\\u003E not tax free. The $399 billion dollar amount is an estimate of how much taxes working people avoid by contributing minus how much retirees pay when they withdraw each year. The government is losing so much money because 401(k)s are still relatively new and people are only now starting to retire and withdraw from them.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt\\u0026#8217;s also worth noting that the tax deferred status of these retirement accounts come with risks for savers. In particular, savers are making a bet on what future tax rates will be when they make withdrawals.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESecond, the taxes retirees pay on withdrawals are a powerful tool for policy makers to alter spending in retirement. Without facing a tax on withdrawals, someone might spend everything quickly and rely on government benefits. Others will spend too little and face a needlessly spare retirement\\u003Cstrong\\u003E.\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ETax incentives can get people to behave better. Currently, Americans pay a tax penalty if they don\\u0026#8217;t take out a \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.schwab.com/public/file/P-1624444/Final_RMD_Guide.pdf\\\"\\u003Ecertain amount\\u003C/a\\u003E from their retirement accounts each year after turning 70.5. That amount, the Required Minimum Distribution (RMD), has a \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w20464\\\"\\u003Ebig influence \\u003C/a\\u003Eon how much many Americans retirees spend.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThis shows how much tax policy can nudge retirees toward spending. That\\u0026#8217;s better than forcing people into more extreme measures, tried in the UK, like requiring people to buy annuities or explicit limits on how much they can take out each year.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe argument for getting rid of tax deferrals is based on bad math and risks taking away a solid policy tool.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=460420\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/460420/should-we-get-rid-of-401ks/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-08-06T10:31:13-07:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/preview/460420\",\"dc_creator\":\"Allison Schrager\",\"media_content_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/vc-1-e1438882924633.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#38;strip=all\\u0026#38;w=150\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"Bag of money.\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/vc-1-e1438882924633.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#38;strip=all\\u0026#38;w=150\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/460420/should-we-get-rid-of-401ks/"], ["published_at", Thu, 06 Aug 2015 17:31:13 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Attacks against 401(k)s are missing the point"], ["updated_at", Thu, 06 Aug 2015 22:42:28 UTC +00:00]]
